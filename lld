factory pattern retun is object
nd that kbject we can pass to class as strategy design pattern
cart.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());
cart.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
cart.setPaymentStrategy(new CryptoPayment());
cart.checkout(); // works with any strategy

here all the paymet methods are given by factory that we are passing to cart as set paymet
now cart will delegate all the futher payment processing requests to inserted object

eg
cart.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());

here CreditCardPayment obj is given by factory
that we insterted into class
now payment proceessing will be handled by creditcard object
