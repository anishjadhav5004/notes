✅ Yes, in some databases (like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle),
you can use TRUNCATE inside a transaction, and you can roll it back if you don’t commit yet.

❌ But in others (like MySQL with MyISAM engine),
TRUNCATE auto-commits — it can’t be rolled back even if you’re inside a transaction.

upsert in tsql

merge into table1 as Target
  using( VALUES (1, 'Anish') ) as source(id,name)
  on Target.id = source.id
when matched then
update Target
 set Target.name = source.name

when not matched then
  insert(name)
  values(source.name)

cte : common table express 
 this is inroduced to store result of any query once nd can be used multiple time , which saves time of calculating same thing again nd again 
   
 recursive cte :
  WITH cte_name AS
(
    -- 1️⃣ Anchor Query (Base case)
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table
    WHERE condition

    UNION ALL

    -- 2️⃣ Recursive Query
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table t
    INNER JOIN cte_name c
        ON join_condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
