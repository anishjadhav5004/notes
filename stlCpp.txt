priority queue:

they are using heap(max and mean) internally.


map : 

it gives output always in ascending orders
Allows fast retrieval using the key (typically O(log n) due to underlying Red-Black Tree,self balancing tree)

unorderd map and unorder set: 
dont store data in order , random data stored
it having timecomplexity O(1) in worst case its O(n)

set : 
self balancing tree
time complexity : log(n)
set<int>s;
*(s.lower_bound(3)) ==> this method in set returns at least 3 if available in set otherwise bigger that 3 which exists like 4,5,6 if no bigger or that exact value is present then it return 0

emplace is the method where you just pass pairs directly instead of passing objetct of it , it is alternative to insert
